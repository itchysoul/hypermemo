    introduction: `King's Family Scripture Memory Challenge

For the remainder of this school year (Epiphany term and Resurrection term), one of our school options, Emmanuel Hall, in forms 3 and 4 are focusing on the Scripture selections below on Faith, Hope, and Love– the theological virtues– and on selections from Shakespeare's Hamlet focusing on the Cardinal virtues– Prudence, Justice, Temperance, and Fortitude.

We pray for our children a love of God apprehended by a hope nourished and sustained by faith in Christ [see Scripture below and Calvin's Institutes 5.3.41-43], and we'd love to invite all the families of King's to join us in the Scripture portion of this memory project.

We're providing memory challenge lapel or backpack pins for all children high school age and under who complete the memory work for FAITH, HOPE, and LOVE with us.

Within the months listed below, February, March, and April, recite the memory work in NKJV word for word to any King's officer or other teacher wearing a silver ear-shaped pin on their lapel at any church event you might see them at.

Children under 12 can do the shorter version for each selection which end at the lines ending with an "aleph":
—----------------------א

Children under 8 can do the even shorter bolded verses.

The standard for passing is no more than two incorrect words per passage and no prompts provided by the listener. If you get it incorrect, you can retry another week or even with another listener on the same week. Please bring a copy of the passage to make this quick and easy for our listeners to verify.`,

    introduction: `Manny Hall 2026 Epiphany and Resurrection Term Memory Work, Form 3 and 4

For the remainder of this year, we're focusing on the Scripture selections below on Faith, Hope, and Love– the theological virtues– and on selections from Shakespeare's Hamlet (mostly) focusing on the Cardinal virtues– Prudence, Justice, Temperance, and Fortitude.

We'll be performing and testing these in pairs like we did "dueling Shakespeare" last term in which two declaimers are scheduled for exordium to do half each of the selection, but they don't know which half they will be doing until they're on stage!

We've selected a length that should be quite manageable as long as you are consistent, and tried to calibrate by making the form 3 requirement slightly shorter. Feel free to go ahead and add the form 4 verses though if you're on a roll!

This line ending with an "aleph" is used to separate the required Scripture memorization for form 3 vs 4:
—----------------------א

Note: memory work for these is being done in NKJV not KJV. The reason we're doing this is to match the translation being used by The King's Congregation where we are promoting this same memory work.`,
